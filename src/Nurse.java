/**
 * Represents a nurse as Thread in the emergency department.
 * <p>
 * Nurses are responsible for assisting patients and ensuring their well-being during their stay in the hospital.
 * They are allocated to patients and help them move between different locations within the hospital.
 * Nurses also work closely with other hospital staff, such as orderlies, to provide comprehensive care to patients.
 * <p>
 * This class extends the {@code java.lang.Thread} class
 * to allow nurses to run concurrently with other threads in the simulation.
 * Nurses will continuously check for arriving patients in the foyer and assist them if available.
 * When allocated to a patient, nurses will help transfer the patient to their next destination.
 * <p>
 * Note: This class is not thread-safe and should be used in a controlled environment to avoid race conditions.
